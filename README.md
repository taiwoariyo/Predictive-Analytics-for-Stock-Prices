#Predictive Analytics For Stock Prices


STEP 1: DEFINE PROJECT SCOPE

PURPOSE:
Predict stock prices using ARIMA and LSTM models.

CRITERIA:
Accuracy, Performance, Visualizations, Ease of Use.

INPUT:
Stock Ticker, Prediction Method (ARIMA or LSTM).

OUTPUT:
Predicted prices, Visualizations, Model Evaluation Metrics.

KEY FEATURES:
Data Preprocessing, Model Selection, Model Evaluation, Visualizations, User Interface.

 
STEP 2: ARCHITECTURE RESEARCH AND PLANNING

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
Python

TOOLS & LIBRARIES:
•	Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
•	Model Selection: ARIMA, LSTM (TensorFlow)
•	Model Evaluation: Scikit-learn
•	User Interface: Streamlit
•	Visualizations: Matplotlib, Seaborn

 
STEP 3: DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING AUTOMATION

DATA IMPORTING:
Use yfinance to fetch historical stock data (CSV, Yahoo Finance).

DATA PREPROCESSING:
Handle missing values, feature scaling, train-test split.

 
STEP 4: AUTOMATE MODEL SELECTION

MODEL CANDIDATES:
•	ARIMA for statistical forecasting
•	LSTM for deep learning-based forecasting

 
STEP 5: MODEL EVALUATION USING CROSS-VALIDATION

EVALUATION METRICS:
•	ARIMA and LSTM: MAE, RMSE

 
STEP 6: MODEL TUNING AND HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION

TECHNIQUES:
•	Grid Search
•	Random Search (optional)

 
STEP 7: MODEL DEPLOYMENT AND SAVING

MODEL PERSISTENCE:
•	ARIMA: Saved using pickle
•	LSTM: Saved using TensorFlow’s model.save()

 
STEP 8: USER INTERFACE (WEB-BASED)

WEB INTERFACE:
Streamlit for user input (stock ticker, prediction method), displaying predictions and visualizations.

 
STEP 9: TESTING AND VALIDATION

TEST WITH DATASETS:
Test with different stock tickers and both small/large datasets. Handle edge cases.

 
STEP 10: DEPLOYMENT AND MAINTENANCE

DEPLOYMENT:
Deploy on platforms like Heroku or Streamlit Sharing.

MAINTENANCE:
Update models with new data and user feedback.
